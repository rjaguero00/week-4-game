# week-4-game

How to play:

At the start of every round you will be given a random number.

There are 4 different Hogwarts houses, clicking on these houses will add a specific number to "player's score."  Each round the house's values will change.

To win the game you will need to correctly add up player's score to the random number appeared on the page. You lose the game by going over the random number.
